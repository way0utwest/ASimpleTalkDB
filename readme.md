# Simple Talk Demo Database Repo

This is a sample repo of the code in a SimpleTalk database, used for demonstrations from Redgate Software. This is not intended to be a production capable or well modeled database, but a sample on which to experiment.

## Developer Database Setup
ImageName: SimpleTalk_Base
Development DB: SimpleTalk_1_<developer>

Repo: https://www.github.com/way0utwest/ASimpleTalkDB
Database Code Subfolder: dbcode

CI Pipeline: ASimpleTalkDB-HP

## Demo Setup
There is a script in the root of this repo that contains a basic set up script for a database. The name is used only for orgnanization in a demo pipeline, hence the "\_5" included in the name.

After running this script, a sample SQL Data Generator project is included to fill this database with some random data.
